**FindUni**, a platform created to help **Pakistani students easily discover and explore all universities in Pakistan, all in one place**.

ðŸ§© **The Problem**

In Pakistan, many students struggle to find the **right university** because there is **no single, reliable platform** that lists all available options.
Most students **search manually**, visiting multiple websites to check **admission openings, program details**, and **eligibility criteria**.
Due to this lack of awareness and guidance, **many students miss out on the best universities and opportunities**.

ðŸ’¡ **The Solution**

**FindUni** solves this problem by providing a **centralized platform** that displays **all universities of Pakistan** in one convenient location.
Each university listing includes its **official website link**, allowing students to directly visit and explore **admission details, programs, and other essential information**.

This project aims to **simplify the university search process, save time, and guide students toward better academic decisions**, empowering them to choose the university that **best fits their goals and future aspirations**.




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
